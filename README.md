# BookStoreMVC

Fullstack ASP.NET Core e-commerce application for a book store. 
The project started as a code-along of DotNetMastery tutorial, but then I started to develop the application further, adding new features and modifying existing ones.

The majority of the app uses the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. The behaviour of the shopping cart utilizes the communication between the client and the server via API. It provides more smooth and interactive user experience.
